Sending notifications from the browser to the desktop involved making use of the Web Notifications API as well as implementing a Service Worker, a powerful tool that enables a script to be run in the background outside of the main thread, and acts as a proxy between the browser and the network, allowing for capabilities (such as desktop notifications) that are primarily only available in native applications. </p>

The "crawler" takes in a URL, page directory and integer indicating the depth of search desired and runs a breadth-first-search process to explore all the webpages linked from the seed URL onwards. The "indexer" then builds an index data structure from the page directory that the crawler outputs, using a hashtable to keep track of counts of each word on each page. Finally, the "querier" reads in queries from standard input ("and" and "or" sequences) and processes the queries by giving each page a "score" for how well it matches the query based on unions and intersections, and ranks the results accordingly.</p>
